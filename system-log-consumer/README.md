# Mystical System log consumer server

In today's digital landscape, effective log management is paramount for maintaining system integrity, diagnosing issues, and ensuring seamless operations. The System-Log-Consumer Server, built with Node.js and integrated with Redis and MongoDB, serves as a crucial component in modern log management ecosystems. In this service, we delve into the architecture, functionalities, and advantages of the System-Log-Consumer Server, emphasizing its role in consuming log events, storing them in MongoDB, and ensuring fault tolerance in the face of system errors.

#### `The Importance of Log Management:`
Logs are invaluable sources of information, providing insights into system behavior, errors, and performance metrics. Robust log management practices enable organizations to detect and resolve issues promptly, enhance system reliability, and optimize performance.

#### `Introducing the System-Log-Consumer Server:`
The System-Log-Consumer Server is a pivotal element in log management workflows, automating the ingestion, storage, and analysis of log events. Leveraging Node.js for its backend logic, Redis for event publishing, and MongoDB for persistent storage, this server seamlessly integrates with existing infrastructures to facilitate efficient log management.

#### `Key Components and Functionality:`

  - `Node.js Backend:` The System-Log-Consumer Server features a resilient Node.js backend responsible for consuming log events 
     from Redis publishers, processing them, and writing them to MongoDB. Its asynchronous architecture ensures efficient 
     handling of log data and seamless integration with other components.

  - `Redis Integration:` Redis acts as the message broker for log events, allowing publishers to broadcast system errors and 
     other log information. The System-Log-Consumer Server subscribes to Redis channels, consuming log events in real-time and 
     processing them for storage.

  - `MongoDB for Log Storage:` MongoDB serves as the primary storage solution for log information. The server writes log events 
     to MongoDB collections, leveraging MongoDB's scalability, flexibility, and querying capabilities.

#### `Handling System Errors:`

  - `Error Types:` The System-Log-Consumer Server is equipped to handle various types of system errors, including syntax 
     errors, type errors, connection errors, and publishing errors generated from API servers and infrastructure components.
    
  - `Real-time Error Detection:` Upon detecting a system error, the server processes the event and prepares it for storage in 
     MongoDB. Real-time processing ensures prompt error detection and enables proactive troubleshooting.
    
  - `Fault Tolerance Mechanisms:` In the event of errors during log processing or storage, such as MongoDB write failures or 
     publishing errors, the server employs fault tolerance mechanisms. If unable to write logs to MongoDB or poll publishing 
     events, the server resorts to writing logs to a default logger, such as a file, ensuring continuity of log management 
     operations.

#### `Benefits of System-Log-Consumer Server:`

  - `Automated Log Ingestion and Storage:` The server automates the ingestion and storage of log events, reducing manual effort 
     and ensuring timely processing of log data.
    
  - `Real-time Error Handling:` By subscribing to Redis channels, the server detects system errors in real-time, enabling 
     proactive troubleshooting and resolution.

  - `Fault Tolerance and Resilience:` Leveraging fault tolerance mechanisms, the server ensures continuity of log management 
     operations, even in the face of system errors or failures.

  - `Enhanced System Reliability:` Effective log management with the System-Log-Consumer Server enhances system reliability, 
     facilitating smooth operations and optimal performance.


### Follow the instruction step by step
Before go to step you should be install node in your system and. i used node 20.x version.


#### Step 1: Set the mongoDB information in .env file
```
MONGO_DB=mystical
MONGO_LOG_TABLE=system-logs
MOGO_URL=mongodb+srv://username:passsword@mystical-std.jyqkmzb.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=mystical-std

```

#### Step 2: Define the REDIS path and Topic name in .env file
```
SYSTEM_LOG_CONTAINER=systemlogs // topic name
REDIS_URL=
```

#### Step 4: Move project root and Install dependency
```sh
cd project-root && npm install
```

#### Step 5: Run server
```sh
npm start
```

In conclusion, the System-Log-Consumer Server plays a critical role in modern log management ecosystems, enabling organizations to ingest, store, and analyze log events effectively. By leveraging Node.js, Redis, and MongoDB, organizations can streamline log management processes, enhance system reliability, and ensure continuity of operations. As businesses strive for operational excellence and system integrity, investing in the System-Log-Consumer Server becomes imperative for maintaining seamless operations and mitigating risks in today's dynamic digital landscape.
